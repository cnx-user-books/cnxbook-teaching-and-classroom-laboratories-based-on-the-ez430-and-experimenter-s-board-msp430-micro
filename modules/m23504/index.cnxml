      <para id="id42962454">Eclipse is a software development platform, developed in Java, which allows it to be used on different operating systems. One of its main features is that it is fully based on plug-ins, which gives it great versatility. Code Composer Essentials (CCE) version 3 is based on Eclipse release 3.2 (Callisto). On the market there are hundreds of plug-ins that can be added in order to enhance or optimize a particular aspect of CCE. One of the available repositories for plug-ins developed for the Eclipse is the Eclipse Plugin Central located at http://www.eclipseplugincentral.com/. This development tool has advanced capabilities to support the development of applications for the MSP430 family. Among them are the support for the use of breakpoints, either hardware or software. CCE supports code debugging activities, with support for features such as code step-by-step execution, or fast and efficient access to registers and memory locations. There is complete compatibility between the C programming language syntax used and the great diversity of code examples available.</para>
